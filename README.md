📄 Policy Document Q&A Assistant

A simple LLM-powered Question & Answer system that allows users to ask questions from a policy PDF document. The system reads the PDF, splits it into meaningful chunks, and uses a Qwen LLM to generate accurate answers based on the document content.

Extracting text from a policy PDF

Splitting the text into manageable chunks

Passing relevant content to a Large Language Model (LLM)

Returning clear, human-readable answers
